# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Getting Started

How to get the website running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheTNTLabs/Website.git
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TheTNTLabs/Website.git
```

2. Install all required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
